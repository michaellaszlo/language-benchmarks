Language benchmarks
===================

The primary goal of this project is to compare the performance of structurally similar programs written in different languages. We cover the following languages:

* Ruby
* Python
* JavaScript
* C++
* C
* Java
* PHP
* Go

A secondary goal of the project is to illustrate how common algorithmic constructs can be implemented in different languages. We are not seeking the most idiomatic or most efficient way of accomplishing each benchmark task. Such considerations are subordinated to the goal of writing structurally similar programs.
